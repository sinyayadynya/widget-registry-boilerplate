# Configuration Management

This project uses the [`config`](https://npmjs.com/package/config) module for configuration
management. Please check the documentation to learn more on how to manage configuration and
overrides per environment.

The Widget Registry Boilerplate comes with a `production` environment and a `sandbox` environment
out of the box. On top of that the `config` module provides implicit support for a `local`
environment.
